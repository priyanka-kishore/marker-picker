# 🎨 Marker Shuffler

**Marker Shuffler** is a small app I’m building to remove decision fatigue when coloring with alcohol markers.

It helps you pick a marker so you can start coloring instead of staring at your collection wondering where to begin.

## The Problem

Choosing a color is easy—until you own a lot of markers.
Then “just starting” becomes the hardest part.

Overthinking kills momentum. Marker Shuffler exists to fix that.

## The Solution

* Pick (or shuffle) a marker from a defined set or palette
* Reduce friction
* Get coloring faster

No setup rabbit holes. No feature overload. Just action.

## Current Capabilities

* Simple marker selection
* Minimal UI designed to stay out of the way
* Built for speed, not perfection

## What’s Next

* **Marker Sets**
  Create and choose from predefined sets (e.g. *SFAIH 101-count*, custom collections, etc.)

* **Palettes (Color Groups)**
  Build and select palettes within a set—warm tones, cool tones, red & green, chaos mode, you name it.

* **Split Screens (Coloring With Friends)**
  Multiple side-by-side pickers so each person can use their own marker set and/or palette while coloring together.

## Status

🛠️ Actively building. Shipping incrementally.

## Why This Exists

Because starting matters more than choosing the “right” color.
